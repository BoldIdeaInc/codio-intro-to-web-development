Your client wants you to make a link on your "table" HTML page so that users can get back to the home page.

1. Read the [Hyperlinks][1]{.preview data-panel="2"} section in your HTML Reference to learn how to create a link
2. On your `table.html` page, add a hyperlink element (`<a>`), just above the main heading.
3. Set the `href` attribute to your home page. The URL for your home page is **"index.html"**.
4. The text for the link should say something like "Go to Home", "Back Home".
5. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview, and click on the link you just made. It should take you to the home page.
