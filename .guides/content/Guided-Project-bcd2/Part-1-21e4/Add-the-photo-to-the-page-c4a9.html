# Add the photo to the page

::: infobox .find
HTML Reference: [Images](https://static.boldidea.org/courses/webdev/html-reference/#images)
:::

The `<img>` element embeds an image into the page. It has an *attribute*{.voc} called `"src"` that tells the browser where to find the image so that it can display it on the page.

1. Now that our image is uploaded, we can add the `<img>` element to our page, just below the main heading:
   ```html {data-added-lines="5"}
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <body>
       <h1>Jack and Jillâ€™s Candy Shop</h1>
       <img src="images/store.jpg">
       <p>
          Welcome to our website! Our candy is the best in town.
   ```
   ::: infobox .important
   Be sure to use the name of the file you uploaded, and make sure the file is inside the `images` folder.
   :::

2. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Preview your page. Notice how the image is way too big! Let's add a `width` attribute to the `<img>` element to make it smaller:
   ```html
       <img src="images/store.jpg" width="400">
   ```
   
3. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview again. The image should now be smaller.
