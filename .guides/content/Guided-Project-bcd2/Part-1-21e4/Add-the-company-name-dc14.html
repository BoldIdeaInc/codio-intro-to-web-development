Your pages will likely have sections of content on them, and each *section*{.voc} should have a heading. The `<body>` is our *top-level*{.voc} section (the outermost), so we’ll use the `<h1>` element. 

1. Add your `<h1>` element inside the `<body>` with your client's company name  
  (look at your [email][1]{.preview data-panel="2"} to find the company name):

   ```html {data-added-lines="4" data-header="Example heading"}
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
    <body>
      <h1>Jack and Jill’s Candy Shop</h1>
    </body>
   </html>
   ```

::: infobox
**Note:** All examples in this guide will be using &ldquo;Jack and Jill’s Candy Shop&rdquo;. 
Be sure to use the information provided by your client in their website!
