# How to write a CSS rule

Here's what a CSS rule looks like:

- You start by writing a *selector*{.voc} that matches the elements you want to style
- Then you add style *declarations*{.voc} to change the look and feel

The above rule uses an element selector to make all `<h1>` elements orange and centered.

An *element selector*{.voc} is just the name of an element (without the &lt;angle&gt; brackets). It matches **all** elements with that tag name.

## Try it out!
In your editor on the left we've opened two files in separate tabs: an HTML file (which ends with `.html`), and a CSS file (which ends with `.css`, currently shown).

1. In the CSS file, add the two style declarations shown above in "Anatomy of a CSS rule" (`color` and `text-align`).
   ::: infobox .warning
   Be sure to put your style declarations **inside** the rule, between the `{` and `}` braces.

2. Refresh the preview below.
3. You should see the page heading is now orange and centered on the page!
