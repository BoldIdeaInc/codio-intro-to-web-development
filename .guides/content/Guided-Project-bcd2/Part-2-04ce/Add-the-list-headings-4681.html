# Add the list headings

Your client has asked you to add headings to each list. These are 2nd-level headings (you already have a 1st-level heading for the body). Because these are 2nd-level headings, you'll want to use the `<h2>` element.

1. Put the `<h2>` heading element just above the opening `<ul>` or `<ol>` tags in your code. 
2. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview. Each list should look something like the one below:

   ::: div .small
   *Note: this is just an example. Be sure to use the list headings provided by your client.*
   :::
   
   ![](.guides/img/list-headings-example.png)
      
{.steps}
