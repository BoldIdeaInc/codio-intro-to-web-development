# Embed a Google Map

Adding an interactive map is actually really easy because Google has done most of the difficult coding for us. All we have to do is use a "snippet" of code to have a fully-functional Google map right on our website.

## How to embed a Google Map on your webpage

1. Click [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/map-generator){target="_blank"} to go to the Google Maps embed API page (you can switch tabs to come back here at look at the instructions)
2. Scroll down to "Generating an iframe" section of the page.
3. Under "I want to..." Enter the company's address from their email in the box under "highlight a place or an address" and click "looks good"
4. Highlight the API key in the box below and copy and paste it into the "Enter your API key" box and click "done".  
   <input readonly="readonly" class="api-key" type="text" value="AIzaSyCema48hs-LMIJCk_VZUQE994IsVQOidA8">
   <output></output>
5. Copy and paste the generated `<iframe>` HTML element into your your code under the "Our Location" heading.
6. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview. You should now see a google map on your page!
7. Make sure the preview looks like the wireframe your client provided. The two sections should be side-by-side.
