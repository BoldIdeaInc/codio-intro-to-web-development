# Make the links look more like buttons

Let's add some more CSS code to make the links look like buttons.

1. In the rule for your nav link elements, add some `margin` and `padding` (`10px` is always a good start, but experiment to see what looks best to you).
2. Set the `background-color` property to a darker color (use your [CSS Colors Names][1]{.preview data-panel="2"} reference).
5. If you used a somewhat dark or bold color for the background, set the `color` property to `white` to make it easier to read.
3. Set the `text-decoration` property to `none` to remove the underline.
4. Set the `text-align` property to `center` to make sure the text stays centered within the button.
5. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview. Your nav bar should now look something like this:
