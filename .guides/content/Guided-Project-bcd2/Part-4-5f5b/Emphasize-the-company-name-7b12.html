Your client has asked you to emphasize their company name anywhere that it's mentioned on the website. You can emphasize text using `<em>` element:

![](.guides/img/em-element-example.png)

The `<em>` element is what's known as an *inline*{.voc} element. In HTML, elements can be either *block*{.voc} or *inline*{.voc}, which affects how they are laid out on the page.

1. Learn about [Inline vs. Block elements][1]{.preview data-panel="2"} in your CSS Reference.
2. Find the company name anywhere it's mentioned in your code (not including the `<h1>` on the home page) and enclose it within `<em>` and `</em>` tags. Be sure to check all `.html` pages.
3. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview and check the pages you just changed. By default, the browser will set the font style to *italic* for all `<em>` elements. But, we don't need it to be italic. Instead, we want it to be bold and a different color. 
{.steps}

You can override the browser's default styling by setting any of those properties to a different value. In our case, we don't want italic, so we set `font-style` to `normal` in our CSS code.

3. Read the [Text formatting][2]{.preview data-panel="2"} section in your CSS reference.
4. Create a new CSS rule in your `style.css` file that matches all `<em>` elements.
5. Add the declaration `font-style: normal` inside that rule.
6. Next, change the `font-weight` and `color` properties to style the emphasized text whichever way you want. Check out the CSS reference if you're not sure what those do.
7. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview, and make sure all the `<em>` elements are colored and bold.
