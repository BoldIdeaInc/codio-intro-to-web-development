# Guided Project - Part 4

## You have a new email!

Your client wants some changes made to the website. 

1. Read through the email to make sure you understand the requirements. (Don't worry, we'll guide you through each step!)
2. Download the wireframe image from the email by clicking on each attachment. You won't need to upload this one, but you'll want to open it on your computer so you can see it bigger.

Continue to the next step!
