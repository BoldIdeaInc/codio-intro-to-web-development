Your client has given you content for a new page. 

1. Create a new file by selecting "File -> New File". Name the file `table.html`.
{.steps}

## Create the base HTML structure
::: infobox
If you can't remember how to do any of these steps, look at your `index.html` file for hints!
:::
1. Add the base HTML elements for your page, including the **doctype**, **html**, and **body**.
2. Add a `<head>` element just before `<body>`, but inside `<html>`.
3. Add a `<link>` element inside the `<head>` element that links to *style.css*
4. Add a top-level heading using the `<h1>` element. Use a heading that is appropriate for the page you're creating. Remember to put it inside the `<body>` element!
5. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the `table.html` preview. You should see your new page with a heading.
{.steps .continue}

::: infobox
Notice how the heading uses the same style you defined for your home page. The `<link>` element makes it easy to just have one stylesheet for our entire website, instead of having to re-create one every time we add a web page.
