# Add a page heading and an intro paragraph

Use the `<h1>` element for your page heading, and `<p>` for your introduction paragraph. These should go inside the body element, one after the other.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>How to make Texas Chili</h1>
    <p>
      This how-to will give you step-by-step instructions 
      to help you win your next chili cook-off!
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Refresh your page preview. You should now see your heading in a nice big font at the top of your page!
