# Add the slideshow using JavaScript

Your client has asked you to create a slideshow on this page. This will require some extra functionality that is not available with HTML and CSS alone. We can use *JavaScript*{.voc} to add functionality to our web page that can’t be done with HTML and CSS alone.

Luckily, you don’t have to write your own JavaScript code. Many JavaScript developers make their code freely available online as a *JavaScript library*{.voc}.

1. If you haven't already, upload the slideshow images from the [client email][3]{.preview data-panel="2"} into the `images` folder in your IDE.
2. Read the section on [JavaScript libraries][1]{.preview data-panel="2"} in your HTML Reference.
3. We're going to use a library called *slideshow-js*. This library is hosted on a website called *GitHub*. Click the link below to open the GitHub page in a new tab, and follow the instructions to learn how to use the *slideshow-js* javascript library on your page.
{.steps}

[Open *slideshow-js* GitHub page][2]{.btn target="_blank"}

3. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview to test your code. If your slideshow doesn't work, go back through each step
{.steps .continue}

*Congrats, you've completed Part 3!*
