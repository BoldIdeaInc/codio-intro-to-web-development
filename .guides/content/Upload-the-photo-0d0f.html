# Upload the photo

Before we can add a photo to our page, we need to *upload*{.voc} it to our website.

Because we might be uploading a lot of photos, it would help to keep them all in a *folder*{.voc}.

1. Create a new folder called `images` (all lowercase) by clicking *File > New Folder*.
   :::infobox .warning
   If the folder doesn't show when you create it, make sure you are spelling the folder name exactly as `images` (all lowercase).
   :::
2. Open your [client email][1]{.preview data-panel="2"}
3. Download the image attachment from the email
4. Select the images folder, then click *File > Upload*.
5. Select the downloaded file on your computer, then click "Upload"
