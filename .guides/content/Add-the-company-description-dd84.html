Think of a short description of your client's company based on what you've read about them in their [email][1]{.preview data-panel="2"}.

To create a paragraph of text, use the `<p>` element. Note that blank lines in your code won't show up on your HTML page, so you'll need to use the `<p>` element any time you want to create a new paragraph.

![paragraphs create separation](.guides/img/paragraph.png){.border .shadow}

![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview. You should now see your paragraph underneath the heading.
