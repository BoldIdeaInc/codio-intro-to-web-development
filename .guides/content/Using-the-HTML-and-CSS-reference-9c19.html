# Using the HTML and CSS references

Believe it or not, you don't have to know *everything* about coding to be a successful coder. In fact, professional coders frequently rely on other websites to get their information.

Any time you have a question or don't know how to do something, you just have to know where to look.

We've created two easy-to-read reference guides to help beginner web developers, an **HTML reference** and a **CSS reference**.

## Try it out! View the HTML Reference

1. To open the HTML Reference, click the dropdown button next to the Preview menu at the top of the screen:

   ![](.guides/img/reference-guides-menu.png)
2. This will open the reference guide in a new tab in whatever panel you have selected. Try moving the tab to the same panel as this guide:

   ![](.guides/img/reference-guide-move-tab.gif)
{.steps}

## Switching back to normal preview
3. Once you select a guide, you'll notice that the preview button now defaults to that guide:

   ![](.guides/img/html-reference-preview-button.png)
4. To use the normal preview functionality, just click the dropdown button again to select "Preview home page" or "Preview current page".
