<script type="text/markdown">
# Add a paragraph

1. Use the `<p>` element for your introduction paragraph. This should go inside the body element, just after the heading.

   ```html {data-added-lines="5-8"}
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <body>
       <h1>How to make Texas Chili</h1>
       <p>
         This how-to will give you step-by-step instructions 
         to help you win your next chili cook-off!
       </p>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. Click the "refresh" button to re-load the page. You should now see your paragraph just below the heading.
