# Behind the Curtain

In this course, you'll learn how to make your own web pages using *HTML*{.voc} and *CSS*{.voc} code. But first, we're going to take a look "behind the curtain" of a website to see how things work.

On the left is a website made by a team of Bold Idea students.

1. Try clicking different links and buttons inside the web page.
2. See if you can identify the following types of content:
   - headings
   - images
   - paragraphs
   - links or buttons
{.steps}

Click **next** to take a look behind the curtain to see how this website was made.
