# Behind the Curtain: CSS

Next, let's take a look at some *CSS*{.voc} code. This code is responsible for the *style* of the website, such as colors, fonts, layout, and more.

## Try hacking the CSS code
1. Let's try changing the background color. On line 2, you'll see the words `background-color`. 
2. Replace the code `#A9F5F2` with the name of a color (all one word), for example: `pink` (make sure to leave the semicolon `;` at the end).
3. Refresh the preview by clicking the refresh button ![refresh button](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png). You should now see the page has a different background color!
4. Now look for the line that says `text-align: center` and change it to `text-align: left`.
5. Refresh the preview again to see what happens.
6. Try changing some more things in the CSS file and see what happens.

**Remember:** Any time you change code, you'll have to *re-fresh* the preview by clicking the refresh button ![refresh button](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png).
