# Add your steps as an ordered list

HTML has two types of lists: *ordered*{.voc} and *unordered*{.voc}. 

Since youâ€™re making a step-by-step howto, order is important, so you should use the `<ol>` (ordered list) element. 

Each item inside that list is an `<li>` (list item) element.

```html {data-added-lines="9-15"}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>How to make Texas Chili</h1>
    <p>
      This how-to will give you step-by-step instructions 
      to help you win your next chili cook-off!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook first 4 ingredients in a large skillet</li>
      <li>Stir until beef crumbles and is no longer pink</li>  
      <li>Drain and place mixture in 5-quart slow cooker</li>   
      <li>Stir in beans and remaining ingredients</li>
      <li>Cook at HIGH 3 to 4 hours or at LOW 5 to 6 hours</li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
```

::: infobox warning
Be sure to put your ordered list *after* the paragraph, but *inside* the body. Also, notice how all `<li>` elements are contained inside a single `<ol>` element.
