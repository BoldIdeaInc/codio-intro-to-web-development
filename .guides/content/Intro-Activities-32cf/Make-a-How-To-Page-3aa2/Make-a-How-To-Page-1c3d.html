# Make a How-To Page

In this activity, you will create your own "how-to" web page, which is a step-by-step instruction page on how to do some kind of task.

## Step 1: Plan your content

Find a piece of scratch paper and a pen or pencil. Think of an idea for your how-to page. For example, you could make a page on how to cook a favorite dish, how to build something, or how to beat a level or score an achievement in a game.

Spend about 10 minutes planning the content for your page. Write down a title for your page, a short intro paragraph (about one sentence), and a list of instructional steps, in order.
