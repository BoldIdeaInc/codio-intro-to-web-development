# Nesting
Elements can be put inside other elements. This is called *nesting*{.voc}. You can put something inside an element by putting it between its opening and closing tags:

:::: div .flex
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My Heading</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Top 5 movies</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Toy Story 4</li>
        <li>Detective Pikachu</li>
        <li>Spiderman</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Cat Breeds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tabby</li>
        <li>Persian</li>
        <li>Maine Coon<li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```
::: div .pad-med
This HTML produces the following structure:

Notice how the diagram above looks like a family tree? We use the same terms in HTML to describe the relationship between elements and how they are nested:

|                    |                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *parent*{.voc}     | The parent of `<h2>` is `<section>`, and the parent of `<section>` is `<body>`. |
| *child*{.voc}      | `<h2>` and `<ul>` are children of `<section>`. The `<ul>` has four children.    |
| *descendent*{.voc} | `<li>` is a descendent of `<ul>`, `<section>`, `<body>`, and `<html>`.          |
| *ancestor*{.voc}   | `<section>` is an ancestor of `<h2>`, `<ul>`, and all `<li>` elements within.   |
