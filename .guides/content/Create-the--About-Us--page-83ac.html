# Create the "About Us" page

Your client now wants you to add a new HTML page called "About Us". They want a heading, a paragraph that describes their company (you can copy-and-paste it from their email), and a slideshow.

## Create the new page
:::infobox .find
HTML Reference: [Document Structure][1]{.preview data-panel="2"},
[Headings][2]{.preview data-panel="2"},
[Paragraphs][3]{.preview data-panel="2"}
:::

1. First, create a new HTML file called `about-us.html`.
{.steps}

You should have a good idea of how to create a new page by now, but here's a quick reminder:

2. Add `<!DOCTYPE html>` on the first line
3. Add the `<html>` element just after that
4. Add the `<head>` and `<body>` elements inside the `<html>` element
5. Link your existing stylesheet by adding a `<link>` element inside `<head>`
{.steps .continue}

## Add a home link and a top-level heading
6. Add a hyperlink (`<a>`) element that links back to your home page, just like you did on the table page.
7. Add your top-level page heading (`<h1>`) with "About Us" inside the body, and the paragraph (`<p>`) just after that. 

   You can copy-and-paste the paragraph content from your [client email][4]{.preview data-panel="2"}.
8. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the `about-us.html` preview to test your code. Your page heading should have the same style as your other pages. If it doesn't, check your code for the `<link>` element.
