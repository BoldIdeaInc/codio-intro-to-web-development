# Elements

Web pages are made up of *elements*{.voc}. Some elements have other content inside them. For example, a paragraph element looks like this:

![element structure](.guides/img/element-structure.png)

The *contents*{.voc} of an HTML element are the stuff that goes between the *opening and closing tags*{.voc} - this is what we mean when we say "inside" an element. Elements can contain things like text or even other elements.

When we put one element inside another element, we call it *nesting*{.voc}.

::: infobox
Some elements, such as `<img>`, do not have closing tags, because they do not have text content inside them, and they cannot contain other elements.
