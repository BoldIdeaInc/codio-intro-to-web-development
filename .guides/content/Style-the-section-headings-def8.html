# Style the section headings

::: infobox
CSS Reference: [Combinators][1]{.preview data-panel="2"}  
HTML Reference: [Nesting Elements][2]{.preview data-panel="2"} *(descendent)*
:::

The next requirement is to make each list heading the same color as its border.

1. Write a new style rule that selects `<h2>` and changes the color:  
   *Note: this example uses orange -- use one of your colors you chose earlier!*
   ```css
   h2 {
     color: orange;
   }
   ```
2. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview. Notice how *both* list headings have the same color. We want them to be different!
3. You *could* give each `<h2>` element its own class name like we did in the previous step, but there's an easier way using *combinators*{.voc}.

   Change the element selector by *combining* it with the class selector:
   ```css {data-removed-lines="1" data-added-lines="2" data-caption="Select the h2 element inside the .list-1 element"}
   h2 {
   .list-1 h2 {
     color: darkslateblue;
   }
   ```
   CSS *combinators*{.voc} allow you to match elements that are a *descendent* of another. In our document, the `<h2>` is a *descendent* of `<section>`.
4. Write a second rule using a combinator for your other list, so that each list has its own specific color:

   ![](.guides/img/combinators.png)
5. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview, and make sure each section heading has a color that matches the section border.
