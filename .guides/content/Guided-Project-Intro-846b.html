# Guided Project

For this project, you will be acting as your own web development agency.

There are three potential **clients** who are ready to hire you to build a website for them! But, you only have time to do one, so you must choose your favorite!

Your client will tell you what they want on their website by giving you a set of *requirements*{.voc}. Your client doesn't know how to code, but you do! So, it's up to you to make it happen!

This project is divided up into **4 parts**. Please complete all requirements for each part before moving onto the next set of requirements.
