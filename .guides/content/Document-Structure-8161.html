# Document Structure

A web page can be thought of as a document written in HTML. All HTML documents should have `<!DOCTYPE html>` as the first line, and have one `<html>` element. Any *visible* content on your web page goes inside the `<body>` element, like so:

The heading, paragraph, and list elements are the contents of the `<body>` element, so we say they're "inside" the `<body>` element.

Any *visible* elements on your page *must* go inside the  `<body>`.

Here are the main parts that every HTML document should have in it:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` code at the top is a special tag that tells the browser what type of file it’s loading.
- The `<head>` element contains info about the page that the browser needs to know, such as how to load the page styles, or other data used by search engines.
- The `<body>` element contains any content that’s visible on the page. This is where you put all the words, images, and other content that you want people to see.
- Both the head and body must go inside the `<html>` element.
