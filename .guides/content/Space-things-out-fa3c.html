# Space things out

::: infobox .find
CSS Reference: [Box Model][1]{.preview data-panel="2"}
:::

In visual design, *white space*{.voc} is very important. Without it, things look cluttered and are difficult to read. Which of the two layouts below looks better to you?

![](.guides/img/whitespace.png)

![](.guides/img/box-model.png){.float-right .m5 .s6}
In the above example on the right, there is spacing on the outside of the border as well as spacing on the inside.

Spacing on the outside is called *margin*{.voc}, while spacing on the inside is called *padding*{.voc}. This is defined by the *CSS Box Model*{.voc}.

## Update your CSS
1. Read about the [Box Model][1]{.preview data-panel="2"} in your CSS Reference.
2. Click the "Run Simulator" button and experiment with box model properties online.
3. In your `style.css` file, inside your `section` rule, add `margin` and `padding` declarations. Try different settings to see what you like best!

   **Remember**: when specifying sizes for things like margin and padding, use a CSS unit (such as `10px`).
   
   You can read more about CSS units in the [CSS Reference][2]{.preview data-panel="2"}.

4. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview. You should now see more spacing in and around your list boxes:
