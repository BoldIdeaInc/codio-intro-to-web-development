# Build the table

::: infobox .find
HTML Reference: [Tables][1]{.preview data-panel="2"}
:::

Your client gave you a list of items to show on this new page, and each item has several things in common. This type of information is best displayed in a *table*{.voc}, which has *rows* and *columns*.

1. Review the section on [Tables][1]{.preview data-panel="2"} in the HTML Reference to learn how to use tables and how to build them.
2. Open the client email, look at the list of information they gave you, and decide what columns your table should have.   
   [Open Email][2]{.btn .preview data-panel="2"}
3. Upload the images from the client email to the `images` folder in your IDE (each row of your table will have a column with an image inside it).
3. Start your table by adding an empty `<table>` element. 
4. Place an empty row inside the table using the `<tr>` (table row) element. 
5. Your first row is going to be your column headers. Header cells use the `<th>` element for each column header. Add a `<th>` element for every column inside the `<tr>`.
6. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview panel. You should now see your table headers in a table format.
7. Next, add the first row with the data your client gave you. This looks just like the header row, but instead of `<th>` we're going to use `<td>` (table data) for each cell.
   ::: infobox .important
   Make sure your `<td>` elements are *inside* the `<tr>` (table row) element.
   :::
8. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview. You should now see the first row of data underneath the column headers.
   ::: infobox .warning
   For the image column, be sure to use the `<img>` element with the `width` attribute so the image doesn't take up too much space! For example, use `<img width="100">` (use whatever size you think looks best!).
   :::
9. Now add the rest of the rows. Here's a quick tip: **use copy-and-paste** to make things faster! 
   - Highlight the HTML for the first data row (including the `<tr>` and all `<td>` cells)
   - Press [[Ctrl+C]] to copy
   - Place the cursor on the next line, and press [[Ctrl+V]] to paste.
   - Then just change the content inside each `<td>` element that you pasted. This saves a lot of typing!

![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview to make sure everything looks good!
