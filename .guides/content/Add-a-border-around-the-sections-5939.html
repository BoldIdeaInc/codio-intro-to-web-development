# Add a border around the sections

CSS Reference: [Selecting Elements](https://static.boldidea.org/courses/webdev/css-reference/#selecting-elements){.preview data-panel="2"}
:::

1. Add a new *rule*{.voc} in your stylesheet that selects the `<section>` elements and adds a border style around it. 
   ```css
   section {
     border: 4px solid black;
   }
   ```
2. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview.  You should now see a thick black border around each section.

   ![](.guides/img/section-border-example.png)
   
   Notice how you only need *one rule* to style both sections! Using an element name as your selector matches **all elements** with that name.

Can you point out the *selector*{.voc} in the rule you just wrote?
