# Navigation Menus

Almost every website has a navigation menu. Without it, users don't know where to find information on your website. The navigation menu works kind of like a menu at a restaurant. It gives you a quick glance of everything that's available without giving you too many details. On websites, navigation menus are just a collection of hyperlinks (`<a>` elements) that are often styled to be user-friendly.

The above image shows an example navigation menu. This common style of menu is what's known as a "navigation bar", since the menu items form a horizontal bar at the top of the page.
