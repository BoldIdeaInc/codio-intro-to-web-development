# Copy your nav menu into the other pages

Once you're happy with your navigation menu, you can add it to the other pages on your site.

1. Copy and paste the `<nav>` element from `index.html` into your other pages. That way your navigation menu will show on every page!
2. Now that you have a navigation menu, you can remove the "back to home" links from your pages.
3. Refresh your preview and make sure the nav bar works on every page!
