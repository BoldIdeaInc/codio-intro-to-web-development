# How selectors work

The client wants to change the border colors. In *Part 2*, you put your list headings inside `<section>` elements, allowing you to put a border around both.

You used `section` for your CSS selector, which selects all `<section>` elements on a page and applies the styling rule to it. The diagram below shows how this works:

The purpose of a *selector*{.voc} (circled above) is to "select" one or more elements in your document and allow you to style them with one CSS rule.

## Try it out!
1. Try changing the border color in your style rule:
   ```css {data-em-lines="2"}
   section {
     border: 4px solid orange;
     margin: 10px;
     paddnig: 10px;
   }
   ```
   See how both sections have the same color? 
   
   While itâ€™s useful to just write one rule to style multiple elements, we want a different border color for each section. If our elements were different, we could write two rules with different selectors.
