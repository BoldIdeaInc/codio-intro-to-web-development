# Behind the Curtain: HTML
On the far left side of the screen, you'll see the *HTML*{.voc} code for the home page. It probably looks like a foreign language to you. That's because it IS a language!

*HTML*{.voc} stands for "HyperText Markup Language" (tough that's not super important to remember unless you want to impress your friends with some big brain words).

The panel below the code is called the *preview*{.voc}. This loads all our *HTML*{.voc} code in the web browser and displays our web page for us.

## Try it out: Hacking the Code

1. Look through the code and see if you can find where the heading is that says "Welcome to our store. We hope you like it!"
2. Notice the heading is in between a couple of *HTML*{.voc} tags: `<h2>` and `</h2>`. The "h2" stands for "heading level 2".
3. Try changing the heading to something else (type whatever you want!). Don't change the `<h2>` and `</h2>` tags (leave those there).
4. Click the refresh button ![refresh button](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) to re-load the preview. 5. You should now see your new heading on the web page in place of the old one.
6. Try changing some more things in the HTML file and see what happens!

**Remember:** Any time you change code, you'll have to *re-fresh* the preview by clicking the refresh button ![refresh button](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png).
