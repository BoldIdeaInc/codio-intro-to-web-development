# Viewing the client email

At any time during this project, you can open the client email by clicking the dropdown button next to the Preview menu at the top of the screen, and clicking "Client Email"

## Try it out!
1. Open the client email by clicking the preview dropdown and selecting "Client Email":
![](.guides/img/open-client-email.png){.border .shadow}

Notice how the menu button will switch to "Client Email" by default. To change it back to preview, just select the dropdown arrow again and select "Preview Home Page".
