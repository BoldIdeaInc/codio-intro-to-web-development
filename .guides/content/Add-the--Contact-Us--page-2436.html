# Add the "Contact Us" page

Your client has given you instructions on how to make the "Contact Us" page. Open the wireframe image they gave you to see what they want it to look like.

## Create a new page and add the sections

1. Create a new file called `contact-us.html` (all lowercase).
   :::infobox .warning
   If the file doesn't show when you create it, make sure you are spelling the file name exactly as `contact-us.html` (all lowercase).
   :::
2. Create the base document structure like before, with `<!doctype html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<link>`, and `<body>`.
   ::: infobox
   **Pro tip:** A really easy way to do this is copy-and-paste an existing page, and remove everything inside the `<body>` element.
   :::
2. Next, add a heading using an `<h1>` element. Type "Contact Us" inside the `<h1>`.
3.  ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the `contact-us.html` preview and make sure the heading has the same style as your other pages. If it doesn't, check your `<link>` element.
{.steps}

As you can see from your client's email, they want two sections side-by-side. You've done something similar on your home page.

3.  Add a `<div>` element to act as a container for both sections, and give it the same class name you used for your homepage lists (`class="side-by-side"`).
4.  Add two `<section>` elements inside the container.
5.  Within each section, place the appropriate `<h2>` heading (refer to the wireframe photo your client gave you).
6.  ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the `contact-us.html` preview and make sure the two sections are side-by-side.
7.  In the "contact info" section, use three `<p>` elements. One for the name, one for the email, and one for the location address.
8.  In the address, put a **line break** (`<br>`) after the street name, so the street name is on one line, and the city, state, and zip are on the next.
9.  For the email address, use a mailto: hyperlink, like so: 
    ```html
    <a href="mailto:whatever@example.com">whatever@example.com</a>.
    ```
    This will open the user's email program when clicked.
10. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh your preview and make sure the contact info looks correct.
