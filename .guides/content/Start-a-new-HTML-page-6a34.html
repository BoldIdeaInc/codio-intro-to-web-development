# Start a new HTML page

On the far left, you'll see the *file tree*{.voc}. This is a list of files in your workspace.

1. Create a new file called `index.html` by clicking the "File" menu, then "New File". 
2. Then, add the following code to your index.html file to define the document structure (youâ€™ll need to do this every time you start a new HTML page):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
</script>
