# Styling individual elements

Your client now wants three changes to the lists on the homepage:

1. The borders around each of the lists should have a different color.
2. Each list heading should have the same color as the border.
3. The lists should be side-by-side, instead of on top of each other.

The client wants you to choose the colors, but your lists need to look something like this:

![](.guides/img/styled-lists-example.png)

## Choose two colors
There are over *16 million* possible colors that can be made in CSS by mixing different amounts of red, green, and blue. But, 148 of those colors can be referred to by name.

**Choose two colors** from the *Color Names* section in your CSS Reference. Make a note of the color names you want to use (you can always open the CSS reference later if you need to).
