# Build the navigation HTML

::: infobox .find
HTML Reference: [Sectioning][1]{.preview data-panel="2"}
:::

The `<nav>` element serves as a container for our navigation items, and tells the browser that the elements inside it are intended for navigation.

1. On your home page (`index.html`), put a `<nav>` element at the very top of the page, just under the opening `<body>` tag.
   ::: infobox
   Devices called *screen readers* look for `<nav>` elements to help people with a vision impairment such as blindness to navigate websites. It's always a good idea to make your website accessible, even to those who can't see it.
   :::
2. Inside your `<nav>` element, add hyperlinks for each page using `<a>` elements.

   *Below is an example -- you'll need to adjust the links to match your site:*
   ```html
   <nav>
     <a href="index.html">Home</a>
     <a href="products.html">Our Products</a>
     <a href="about-us.html">About Us</a>
     <a href="contact-us.html">Contact Us</a>
   </nav>
   ```
