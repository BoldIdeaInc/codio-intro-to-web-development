# Add the lists to your page

::: infobox .find
HTML Reference: [Lists](https://courses.boldidea.org/webdev/html-reference/#lists){.preview data-panel="2"}
:::

Your client gave you two types of lists. In one list, the order doesn’t really matter. But in the other list, the order is important (for example, in a “Top 10” list).

## Add the unordered list
1. Look at your [client email][1]{.preview data-panel="2"} and look at the list they gave you where the order doesn't matter.
2. Add the *unordered list*{.voc} at the end of the body (after the pargraph, but before the `</body>` tag):
   ```html {data-added-lines="4-10" data-header="Example list (see your client email for actual content)"}
       <p>
         This is another paragrah
       </p>
 
       <ul>
         <li>Gummy candy</li>
         <li>Suckers</li>
         <li>Chocolates</li>
       </ul>

     </body>
   </html>
   ```
3. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview. You should now see your list with bullet items:
   ![](.guides/img/unordered-list-example.png)
{.steps}

## Add the ordered list
4. Look at your client email and find the list they gave you where they have a specific order.
5. Do the same thing as you did with the unordered list, but this time add the *ordered list*{.voc} element. Put the ordered list just after the closing tag of your unordered list.

   Can't remember how to make an *ordered list*{.voc}? Go back one page to see how!

6. ![](.guides/img/refresh-preview.png) Refresh the preview. You should now see your list with bullet items:
{.steps .continue}

Great work! Next we're going to learn how to add some **style** to our page.
